# hello-world
This is is my first time on Github!
Thomas here, I like SQL and Python!
I recently graduated from Bluffton University with a degree in Biology and minor in Chemistry.
I enjoy sci-fi shows and games.
I started to code for a possible career change!
Looking forward to contributing to such a great community!
